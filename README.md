# Grow Calculators
Will be useful to design LED grow laps inside grow-boxes. 
See deployed version: https://el-fuego.github.io/grow-calculators/ 

All the data will be stored to your browser local storage.

## Light intensity visualization
Each circle is how light шы distributed on a surface.

You can drag the light points and increase-decrease length from greens surface to lights and see how many light intensity will be placed on each surface point.
